# Model Name Manager Error Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
When opening the Model Name Manager, the following error occurred:
```
'QTableWidgetItem' object has no attribute 'setStyleSheet'
```

## Root Cause
The error was in `core/model_name_manager.py` line 272, where I incorrectly tried to call `setStyleSheet()` on a `QTableWidgetItem`. The `QTableWidgetItem` class doesn't have a `setStyleSheet()` method.

## Solution
**Before (Incorrect):**
```python
normalized_item.setStyleSheet("background-color: #ffffcc;")  # ❌ Error!
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
from PyQt5.QtGui import QColor
normalized_item.setBackground(QColor(255, 255, 204))  # ✅ Correct!
```

## Changes Made
1. **Added QColor import** to `core/model_name_manager.py`
2. **Replaced `setStyleSheet()` with `setBackground()`** using QColor
3. **Used RGB values (255, 255, 204)** for light yellow highlighting

## Result
- ✅ Model Name Manager dialog now opens without errors
- ✅ Visual highlighting still works (shows which model names will change)
- ✅ All functionality preserved

## Status
**FIXED** ✅ - The Model Name Manager now works correctly.

You can now:
1. Launch MetaPicPick: `python metapicpick.py`
2. Go to Statistics tab
3. Click "Model Name Manager" 
4. The dialog will open successfully with highlighted changes
